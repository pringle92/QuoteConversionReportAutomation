## [1.9.4] - 2025-06-05

### Added
-   **Dependency Injection (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`)**:
    -   Integrated DI container setup in `Program.cs` to manage service lifetimes and dependencies.
    -   Services (`IReportPathService`, `EmailUtility`, `NamedPipeCommunicator`, `ExcelCopyData`, `ReportProcessManager`, `EmailRecipientManager`, `GreetingManager`, `IManualReportOrchestrator`, `AutoRunManager`) registered as singletons.
    -   Dialog forms (`SettingsForm`, `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm`, etc.) registered with transient lifetimes using factories (`Func<bool, TForm>`) to allow passing runtime parameters (e.g., dark mode state).
-   **`IAutoRunUIContext` Interface**:
    -   Defined in `QuoteConversionReportAutomation.Interfaces` to decouple `AutoRunManager` from `Form1`'s `UIManager`.
    -   `Form1` now implements this interface, providing UI update methods for `AutoRunManager`.
-   **Centralized Theming Engine (`ThemeSettings.cs`)**:
    -   Created `ThemeSettings.cs` in `QuoteConversionReportAutomation.Theming` namespace.
    -   This static class holds:
        -   `ApplicationThemeMode` enum (Light, Dark, System).
        -   `ThemePalette` struct defining a comprehensive set of UI colors for various controls and states (including `MenuDropDownBackColor`).
        -   Static `LightPalette` and `DarkPalette` properties.
        -   `CurrentPalette` property to get the active theme's colors.
        -   `EnableCustomTheming` static boolean flag to globGet-ChildItem -Path '<YOUR-SOLUTION-PATH>' -Recurse | Unblock-FileModeEnabled()` static method (moved from `UIManager`) to detect OS dark mode preference via the registry.
        -   `SyncThemeWithSystem()` static method to initialize `CurrentThemeMode` based on OS settings.
-   **Externalized Menu Renderers (`CustomMenuRenderers.cs`)**:
    -   Moved `CustomThemeMenuRenderer` and `CustomThemeColorTable` classes from `UIManager.cs` into a new dedicated file, `CustomMenuRenderers.cs`, under the `QuoteConversionReportAutomation.Theming` namespace.

### Changed
-   **Application Startup (`Program.cs`)**:
    -   Modified to initialize and build the DI service provider.
    -   `Form1` is now resolved from the DI container.
    -   Calls `ThemeSettings.SyncThemeWithSystem()` on startup.
    -   Corrected `Lazy<T>` registration for `AutoRunManager` by explicitly registering `Lazy<IAutoRunUIContext>` with its own factory.
-   **`Form1.cs` Refactoring**:
    -   Constructor updated for DI (receives services, managers, `IServiceProvider`).
    -   Implements `IAutoRunUIContext`.
    -   Dialog forms are opened using `_serviceProvider` and registered factories, passing `ThemeSettings.IsCurrentlyDark()`.
    -   Dark mode toggle (`darkModeToolStripMenuItem_Click`) now updates `ThemeSettings.CurrentThemeMode` and calls `_uiManager.ApplyTheme()`.
    -   Uses `ThemeSettings.IsCurrentlyDark()` for determining theme state for dialogs and internal logic.
    -   Help text (`helpToolStripMenuItem_Click`) now loaded from external RTF files (`Help_Template_Dark.rtf` and `Help_Template_Light.rtf`) with placeholder replacement for dynamic content.
-   **`AutoRunManager.cs` Refactoring**:
    -   Constructor updated for DI, now accepts `Lazy<IAutoRunUIContext>` to resolve circular dependency.
    -   Derives `appSettingsDirectory` (for `autoReportDefinitions.json`) from injected `IReportPathService` and `initialAutoRunHour` from injected `IConfiguration`, simplifying its constructor signature for DI.
    -   UI updates are now done via `_lazyAutoRunUIContext.Value` (which is `Form1`).
-   **`UIManager.cs` Refactoring**:
    -   Removed hardcoded color constants; all colors are fetched from `ThemeSettings.CurrentPalette`.
    * `CustomThemeMenuRenderer` and `CustomThemeColorTable` updated to use `ThemePalette` and `isCustomThemeEnabled` flag.
    -   Theming methods (`ApplyThemeInternal`, `ApplyThemeToExternalForm`, `UpdateControlThemeRecursive`, `UpdateAutoRunUI`) now respect `ThemeSettings.EnableCustomTheming` and use `ThemeSettings.CurrentPalette`.
    -   Reverts to system default appearances if `ThemeSettings.EnableCustomTheming` is `false`.
    -   Removed its local `IsWindowsDarkModeEnabled()`; calls `ThemeSettings.IsWindowsDarkModeEnabled()`.
    -   Corrected `DataGridViewCellStyle` reset when custom theming is disabled.
    -   Corrected menu strip text rendering in `CustomThemeMenuRenderer`.
-   **`HelpForm.cs` Refactoring**:
    * Constructor simplified (removed `isDarkMode` parameter).
    * Theming logic (`HelpForm_Load`, `ApplyChildControlTheme`) updated to use the centralized `ThemeSettings` for all color and theme state decisions.
    * Correctly calls `UIManager.ApplyThemeToExternalForm(this, ThemeSettings.IsCurrentlyDark())`.

### Fixed
-   **Circular Dependency**: Resolved startup issue between `Form1` and `AutoRunManager` using `Lazy<IAutoRunUIContext>` and correct DI registration.
-   **DI `Lazy<T>` Resolution Error**: Corrected registration of `Lazy<IAutoRunUIContext>` in `Program.cs` for `AutoRunManager`'s factory.
-   **Namespace/Type Not Found Errors (CS0246)**: Addressed by ensuring correct `namespace` declarations in form files and corresponding `using` directives.
-   **Duplicate Control Definitions (CS0229, CS0102)**: Fixed in `HelpForm.cs` by removing manual control field declarations, relying on those in `HelpForm.Designer.cs`.
-   **MenuStrip Text Rendering**: Corrected `CustomThemeMenuRenderer.OnRenderItemText` to call base method, making menu text visible again.
-   **`IsWindowsDarkModeEnabled` Call Chain**: Ensured `ThemeSettings.SyncThemeWithSystem()` calls its local method and `UIManager` calls `ThemeSettings.IsWindowsDarkModeEnabled()`.
-   **`DataGridViewCellStyle.Reset` (CS1061)**: Implemented proper reset logic for `DataGridViewCellStyle` in `UIManager.cs`.
-   **`_toggleAutoRunButton` Access (CS0103)**: Corrected in `Form1.cs` by delegating to `UIManager`. Added `ReEnableControlsAfterAutoRun` to `UIManager`.
-   **`MenuBackColor` Property (CS1061)**: Added missing `MenuDropDownBackColor` to `ThemePalette` in `ThemeSettings.cs` and updated `UIManager.cs`'s renderers to use it.

---

## [1.9.3] - 2025-06-02

### Added
-   **Comprehensive Application Settings UI (`SettingsForm.cs`)**:
    -   Introduced a new "Settings..." top-level menu item in `Form1.cs` (between "Options" and "Help") to launch a dedicated `SettingsForm`.
    -   `SettingsForm` allows viewing and editing of application-wide default settings stored in `appsettings.json`.
    -   Features a tabbed interface for organized settings groups: "Application Info", "Paths", "SMTP Configuration", "Email Defaults", "Logging", "Operational Parameters", "Inter-Process Communication", and "AutoRun Process".
    -   Includes appropriate UI controls for different setting types (TextBoxes, NumericUpDowns, CheckBoxes, ComboBoxes).
    -   Incorporates file/folder pickers for path settings.
    -   Implements input validation with an `ErrorProvider` for all editable settings.
    -   Supports dark/light mode theming consistent with the main application.
    -   Provides descriptive tooltips for all settings.
    -   Handles loading settings from `IConfiguration` and saving changes back to `appsettings.json` using `Newtonsoft.Json.Linq` for structured updates.
-   **Logger Enhancements (`Logger.cs`)**:
    -   Added a public static property `IsInitialized` to check if the logger has completed its initialization attempt.
    -   Added a `LogWarning(string message, Exception ex)` overload for logging warnings with associated exception details.
-   **Dynamic Application Identity (`Form1.cs`)**:
    -   `Form1.cs` now reads `AppName` and `AppVersion` from the `ApplicationInfo` section in `appsettings.json`. These values are used for the main window title and in the help information.

### Changed
-   **Major Configuration Refactoring (Alignment with new `appsettings.json` structure)**:
    -   **`appsettings.json` Restructured**: The application's primary configuration file was significantly reorganized. Settings previously under a monolithic "settings" object are now grouped into more specific top-level JSON objects: `ApplicationInfo`, `Paths`, `SmtpConfiguration`, `EmailSettings`, `Logging`, `OperationalParameters`, `InterProcessCommunication`, and `AutoRunProcess`. This improves the clarity, organization, and maintainability of application settings.
    -   **All Relevant Classes Updated**:
        -   `Program.cs`: Enhanced for robust loading of the restructured `appsettings.json` and now passes the `IConfiguration` instance and the full `AppSettingsFilePath` to `Form1.cs`. Improved error handling during startup configuration loading.
        -   `Form1.cs`: Constructor updated to accept `AppSettingsFilePath`. All internal path properties and direct configuration value lookups (e.g., for auto-run hour, timeouts, sheet names, default signature) now use the new keys from the restructured `appsettings.json`. Includes logic to attempt `IConfiguration.Reload()` and call `ReinitializeConfigurableComponents()` after settings are saved via `SettingsForm`, and informs the user about potential restart requirements. Help text generation updated.
        -   `EmailRecipientManager.cs` & `GreetingManager.cs`: Configuration key constants updated to match new paths under `EmailSettings:ProductionRecipients` and `EmailSettings:DebugRecipients` (including nested `EmailGreetings`).
        -   `Logger.cs`: Now reads its settings (base directory, log levels, filename format, archive days, fallback directory) from the new `Paths` and `Logging` sections. `LogLevel` ComboBoxes in `SettingsForm` now include `LogLevel.None` and are ordered by enum value.
        -   `EmailSender.cs` (`EmailUtility` class): Reads SMTP settings from `SmtpConfiguration` and general email/attachment settings (sender info, max size, read retries) from `EmailSettings`.
        -   `NamedPipeCommunicator.cs`: Constructor now takes `IConfiguration`; reads pipe name, connection timeout, and max response size from the `InterProcessCommunication` section.
        -   `ReportArchiver.cs`: `ArchiveOldReportsAsync` method signature changed to accept `configuredArchiveFolderName` parameter, which `Form1.cs` reads from `OperationalParameters:ReportArchiveFolderName`.
        -   `ExcelCopyData.cs`: Constructor now accepts `IConfiguration`. Reads various operational parameters (Excel sheet names, pivot table names, filtering thresholds, financial year start month/day, file operation retry settings) directly from the `OperationalParameters` section.
        -   `FolderCreation.cs`: `GetReportSpecificFolderPath` and `CreateReportSpecificFolder` methods now accept an `IConfiguration` parameter to dynamically use report type folder names from `OperationalParameters:ReportTypeFolderNames`.
        -   `ReportHelper.cs`: `GetFinancialYearDates` method modified to require `startMonth` and `startDay` as parameters (which `Form1.cs` now supplies from `OperationalParameters`). `OpenFileWithDefaultApp` refactored to throw exceptions instead of showing UI messages directly, allowing the UI layer to handle error display.
        -   `ReportProcessManager.cs`: Refactored to remove direct UI calls (`FlexibleMessageBox.Show`). It now throws specific exceptions for failures (e.g., wrapper executable not found, launch errors), which `Form1.cs` can catch and display appropriately. (Receives its executable path from `Form1`, which reads it from `Paths:WrapperExecutable`).
        -   `AutoRunManager.cs`: All internal path properties and direct configuration key access (for `AutoRunProcess:CheckHour`, `AutoRunProcess:LastRunDate`, `AutoRunProcess:DailyRunStatus`, and paths) updated to align with the new `appsettings.json` structure. Uses configured `Paths:ReportDefinitionsFileName`.

### Fixed
-   **Path Handling in `SettingsForm.cs`**: Implemented logic to correctly handle paths intended to be relative to the user's profile. When saving, if a path in the UI (e.g., for `FinalReportOutputBase`, `TemplateBase`, `RawReportOutputBase`) starts with the user's profile path, the profile part is stripped, and a relative path is stored in `appsettings.json`. Application logic correctly prepends the user profile path when using these settings.
-   **Compilation Errors from Refactoring Process**:
    -   Resolved `CS1503` (Argument 4 type mismatch for `ReportArchiver.ArchiveOldReportsAsync` in `Form1.cs`).
    -   Resolved `CS1501` (Incorrect argument count for `FolderCreation.GetReportSpecificFolderPath` in `Form1.cs` - subsequently addressed by signature change in `FolderCreation.cs`).
    -   Resolved `CS0117` (`Logger.IsInitialized` not found in `Program.cs` - addressed by adding public property).
    -   Resolved `CS1739` (Incorrect parameter name `checkExists` for `ValidatePathControl` in `SettingsForm.cs`).
    -   Resolved `CS0165` (Use of unassigned local variable `tlp` in `SettingsForm.cs` theming logic).
    -   Resolved `CS7036` (Missing `IConfiguration` argument for `FolderCreation.GetReportSpecificFolderPath` in `AutoRunManager.cs`).

---

## [1.9.1] - 2025-05-30

### Added
-   **UI for Managing Automated Report Definitions**:
    -   Introduced a new "Manage Automated Reports..." option under the "Options" menu in `Form1.cs`.
    -   Created `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm.cs` to allow users to:
        -   View all existing `AutoReportDefinition` objects in a DataGridView.
        -   Add new report definitions through a detailed input form.
        -   Edit existing report definitions by selecting them in the DataGridView and modifying their properties in the input form.
        -   Delete report definitions with a confirmation prompt.
        -   Directly toggle the `IsEnabled` status of a report definition via a checkbox column in the DataGridView.
-   **UI Enhancements**:
		-   Added descriptive tooltips to various input fields and buttons on the `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm` for improved usability and user guidance.
    -   The form includes functionality to save all changes (additions, updates, deletions, enabled status) to a dedicated configuration file.
    -   Added a prompt on closing the `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm` to save any unsaved changes.
    -   The new form supports dark/light mode theming consistent with the main application.

### Changed
-   **Automated Report Definitions Storage & Management**:
    -   `AutoReportDefinition` objects are now stored in a dedicated `autoReportDefinitions.json` file, located in the same directory as `appsettings.json`. This declutters `appsettings.json`.
    -   `AutoRunManager.cs` has been significantly updated:
        -   Now loads and saves the report definitions from/to this new `autoReportDefinitions.json` file.
        -   The `ReportDefinitions` array has been removed from the `AutoReport` section of `appsettings.json`.
        -   Uses the `IsEnabled` property directly from the `AutoReportDefinition` objects to determine if an automated report should run, replacing the old individual `EnableConfigKey` boolean flags from `appsettings.json`.
        -   Includes a `ReloadReportDefinitions()` method to refresh its internal list if changes are made via the UI.
    -   `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm.cs` interacts with static methods in `AutoRunManager` to load/save definitions using the new dedicated file path.
-   **Model Update (`AutoReportDefinition.cs`)**:
    -   Added an `IsEnabled` boolean property to control if a report definition is active.
    -   Added a `ReportId` (string GUID) property to uniquely identify each definition, which is auto-generated if missing upon loading legacy definitions.
    -   Enhanced with `[JsonProperty]` attributes (Newtonsoft.Json) for all properties to ensure reliable serialization and deserialization with correct PascalCase naming, matching the JSON structure.
-   **`Form1.cs` UI for Auto-Run Configuration**:
    -   Removed the old "Options -> Configure Auto-Run Reports" sub-menu and its individual toggle items.
    -   The click handler for the new "Manage Automated Reports..." menu item now opens `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm` and calls `AutoRunManager.ReloadReportDefinitions()` if changes were saved.
-   **Legacy Code Removal**:
    -   Refined `AutoReportDefinition.cs` by removing the obsolete `EnableConfigKey` property.
    -   Updated `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm.cs` and its designer to remove UI elements (TextBox and Label) related to the legacy `EnableConfigKey`.
    -   Cleaned up `UserEmailSettings.cs` by removing properties for legacy specific automated report email recipient lists (e.g., `ProdAutoRunDailyTo`, `ProdAutoRunWeeklyCC`), as the system now fully relies on the `RecipientCategoryKey` for automated report recipients.
    -   Removed corresponding legacy email list configurations from `appsettings.json` (user performed this step based on previous instructions).
    -   Updated `EmailRecipientManager.cs` to remove logic associated with these removed legacy email recipient list configurations.

### Fixed
-   **Saving Report Definitions**: Resolved issues where changes made in the `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm` (e.g., enabling/disabling reports, adding/deleting definitions, assigning `ReportId`s) were not correctly persisting to the configuration file. This was largely addressed by ensuring correct serialization with `[JsonProperty]` attributes and refining the save logic in `AutoRunManager.cs`.
-   **Deleting Report Definitions**: Fixed a `NullReferenceException` that could occur in `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm.btnDelete_Click` by making the delete operation more robust.
-   **GUID Assignment**: Ensured that `ReportId` (GUIDs) assigned to newly loaded legacy definitions (those previously without an ID) are now correctly persisted when changes are saved.
-   **Form Closing Prompt**: Improved the "unsaved changes" prompt logic in `ManageAutoReportDefinitionsForm` to correctly cancel closing if a save operation initiated by the prompt fails and changes are still pending.

## [1.9.0] - 2025-05-28

### Added
-   **Manual Custom Report Configuration**:
    -   Users can now define specific 'To' recipients, 'CC' recipients, and a unique email greeting for manually run "Custom" type reports.
    -   **`ManageEmailRecipientsForm.cs`**: Added UI elements (programmatically if not in designer, ideally via a new "Manual Custom" tab or section within the "Manual Reports" tab) to configure `ProdManualCustomTo` and `ProdManualCustomCC` lists.
    -   **`ManageGreetingsForm.cs`**: Added UI elements (programmatically if not in designer, typically by adding a new row to the `mainTableLayoutPanel`) to configure a `ManualCustom` greeting.
    -   **`UserEmailSettings.cs` and `UserGreetingSettings.cs`**: Models updated with corresponding properties (`ProdManualCustomTo`, `ProdManualCustomCC` in `UserEmailSettings`; `ManualCustom` in `UserGreetingSettings`).
    -   **`appsettings.json`**: Default entries for `"ManualCustomTo"`, `"ManualCustomCC"`, and `"ManualCustom"` greeting added under `settings:ProductionEmails` and `settings:ProductionEmails:EmailGreetings` respectively.
-   **Flexible Automated Report Recipient Configuration**:
    -   **`AutoReportDefinition.cs`**: Added a `RecipientCategoryKey` string property. This key links an automated report definition to a specific set of recipient lists defined in `appsettings.json` and potentially overridden by the user.
    -   **`appsettings.json`**:
        -   Each object within the `AutoReport:ReportDefinitions` array now includes the `RecipientCategoryKey` property (e.g., `"RecipientCategoryKey": "AutoRunDailyStandardRecipients"`).
        -   New recipient list arrays (e.g., `AutoRunDailyStandardRecipientsTo`, `AutoRunDailyStandardRecipientsCC`) added under `settings:ProductionEmails`. These correspond to the `RecipientCategoryKey` values, allowing distinct recipient lists per automated report category.
    -   **`UserEmailSettings.cs`**: Added new `List<string>?` properties (e.g., `AutoRunDailyStandardRecipientsTo`, `AutoRunWeeklyRecipientsCC`) to allow user overrides for these new category-based automated recipient lists. These properties are initialised in the constructor.
    -   **`ManageEmailRecipientsForm.cs`**: The "Automated Reports" tab's `TableLayoutPanel` (`automatedReportsTableLayoutPanel`) is now programmatically cleared and repopulated by `InitializeAutomatedReportControls()`. This method creates new `Label` and `TextBox` controls for each defined automated report recipient category (e.g., "Auto Std. Daily TO:", "Auto Weekly CC:"), allowing users to override the default lists for these categories.

### Changed
-   **Email Recipient Logic for Manual Custom Reports (`EmailRecipientManager.cs`)**:
    -   `GetCurrentEffectiveSettings()`: Now loads `ProdManualCustomTo` and `ProdManualCustomCC` from user overrides or `appsettings.json`.
    -   `GetRecipients()`: When handling manual runs (i.e., `isAutoRunContext` is `false`), if the `reportTypeIndex` is `CustomReportIndex`, it now uses the `ProdManualCustomTo` and `ProdManualCustomCC` lists from the effective settings.
-   **Email Greeting Logic for Manual Custom Reports**:
    -   **`GreetingManager.cs`**: `GetCurrentEffectiveGreetings()` now populates the `ManualCustom` property by calling `GetGreeting("ManualCustom")`.
    -   **`Form1.cs`**: In `GetEmailSubjectAndBody()`, when processing a manual "Custom" report (and not in debug mode), `greetingKeyName` is now set to `"ManualCustom"` to use the specific greeting for this scenario.
-   **Email Recipient Logic for Automated Reports (`EmailRecipientManager.cs`)**:
    -   The `GetRecipients()` method signature was changed for the auto-run context. It now requires an `AutoReportDefinition` object to be passed when `isAutoRunContext` is `true`.
    -   For automated reports (when `isAutoRunContext` is `true` and not in debug mode), recipients are now determined based on the `RecipientCategoryKey` provided in the `AutoReportDefinition` object. This involves looking up corresponding lists (e.g., `settings.AutoRunDailyStandardRecipientsTo`) from the effective settings.
    -   `GetCurrentEffectiveSettings()`: Updated to load all new category-based recipient lists (e.g., `AutoRunDailyStandardRecipientsTo`) from `appsettings.json` and merge them with user overrides from `UserEmailSettings.cs`.
-   **Automated Report Processing (`AutoRunManager.cs`)**:
    -   The `RunConfiguredAutomatedReportAsync()` method now passes the full `AutoReportDefinition` object (which contains the `RecipientCategoryKey`) to `_emailRecipientManager.GetRecipients()` when `isAutoRunContext` is `true`.
-   **UI for Automated Report Recipients (`ManageEmailRecipientsForm.cs`)**:
    -   `InitializeAutomatedReportControls()`: This method now dynamically creates the UI for editing category-based automated report recipients, clearing previous controls on the "Automated Reports" tab.
    -   `LoadSettingsToForm()` and `BtnSave_Click()`: Updated to correctly load from and save to the new category-based properties in `UserEmailSettings` (e.g., `AutoRunDailyStandardRecipientsTo`).
    -   `SetupToolTips()`: Added tooltips for the new category-based recipient `TextBox` controls.

### Fixed
-   **CS1996 Error in `AutoRunManager.cs`**: Resolved "Cannot await in the body of a lock statement" error in `SetAutoRunHourAsync` by changing the `File.WriteAllTextAsync` call to its synchronous counterpart `File.WriteAllText` within the `lock(_jsonFileLock)` statement. This ensures thread-safe modification of `appsettings.json` while avoiding the await-in-lock issue.
---

## [1.8.10] - 2025-05-21

### Changed
- **Auto-Report Status Logic**:
    - Modified `DailyRunStatus.cs` by adding `AllCurrentlyEnabledAndDueReportsSucceeded` method. This method now considers the `DayOfWeek` to accurately determine if all reports that were *enabled AND scheduled to run* on the current day have succeeded.
    - Updated `AutoRunManager.cs` to utilize the new `AllCurrentlyEnabledAndDueReportsSucceeded` method from `DailyRunStatus.cs`.
    - The status messaging (e.g., "X/Y reports succeeded") in `AutoRunManager.cs` now correctly reflects the count of reports that were *due and enabled* for the day, rather than just all enabled reports. This resolves issues where the status might show "partial success" if a weekly report (enabled but not due) hadn't run.

### Fixed
- **Auto-Report Status Accuracy**: Corrected the auto-report status message to accurately reflect success/failure based on reports that were scheduled to run on a given day, preventing misleading "partial success" messages when some enabled reports (e.g., weekly) were not due.

---

## [1.8.9] - 2025-05-21

### Added
- **Data-Driven AutoRunManager**:
    - Introduced `AutoReportDefinition.cs` model to define properties for each automated report type (e.g., name, enable key, success flag name, date calculation parameters, template, email details).
    - `AutoRunManager.cs` now loads these definitions from `appsettings.json` (`AutoReport:ReportDefinitions` array) and processes reports in a loop based on these configurations.
    - This makes adding new *similar* automated reports primarily a configuration task in `appsettings.json`.
- **Automated Weekly Report (15-Day Rolling)**:
    - Added a "Weekly PowerBI Update" report definition for automated runs.
    - Configured to run on Fridays (can be changed in `AutoReportDefinition` in `appsettings.json`).
    - Report period covers the 15 days ending on the run day (e.g., if run on Friday, it covers the preceding 14 days plus Friday itself).
    - Added "Enable Weekly Auto Report" toggle in `Form1.cs` under "Options -> Configure Auto-Run Reports".
    - Added fields for "Automated Weekly Report TO/CC" in the `ManageEmailRecipientsForm`.
- **Dynamic Daily Report Status Tracking**:
    - `DailyRunStatus.cs` model updated to use `JsonExtensionData` to dynamically store and retrieve success statuses for any report defined in `ReportDefinitions`, rather than relying on fixed properties.
- **`GetPreviousDayOfWeek` Method**: Added to `ReportHelper.cs` to facilitate date calculations for specific days of the week.

### Changed
- **AutoRunManager Core Logic**:
    - `PerformDailyCheckAsync` in `AutoRunManager.cs` now iterates through loaded `AutoReportDefinition`s.
    - Date calculations for daily-type reports in `AutoRunManager.cs` now use `ReportEndDateOffsetDays` and `ReportDurationDays` from their respective definitions.
    - Specific date logic for the automated "Weekly PowerBI Update" (15-day rolling period) implemented in `AutoRunManager.cs`.
    - `SaveDailyReportStatus` and `ResetDailyReportStatuses` in `AutoRunManager.cs` now use the `SuccessFlagJsonName` from the report definition to update the correct flags in `appsettings.json`.
- **Manual Weekly Report Date Logic (`Form1.cs`)**:
    - When "Weekly" is selected in the UI, the date range is now set to the current day as the end date and 14 days prior as the start date, reflecting a 15-day rolling period.
- **`ManageEmailRecipientsForm` UI**:
    - Reorganized using a `TabControl` with three tabs: "Automated Reports", "Manual Reports", and "Debug".
    - Existing email recipient fields distributed to the new "Automated Reports" and "Manual Reports" tabs.
    - "Debug" tab and its fields are only visible in DEBUG builds.
- **Configuration (`appsettings.json`)**:
    - Added `AutoReport:ReportDefinitions` array to store configurations for each automated report.
    - Added `EnableWeeklyAutoReport` (boolean) and `WeeklyReportSucceeded` (boolean under `DailyRunStatus`) to `AutoReport` section.
    - All email recipient lists under `settings:ProductionEmails` and `settings:DebugEmails` are now consistently formatted as JSON arrays.
    - Default recipients for "Automated Weekly Report" (`AutoRunWeeklyTo`, `AutoRunWeeklyCC`) now mirror "TeamTo" and "TeamCC" lists by default.
- **EmailRecipientManager.cs**: Updated to correctly read all email recipient lists from `appsettings.json` as JSON arrays.
- **Application Version**: Incremented to `1.8.9` in `Form1.cs`.

### Fixed
- **AutoRun Daily Status Reset**: Improved logic in `AutoRunManager.cs` for resetting daily report statuses to be more robust, relying on the persisted `StatusDate` in `appsettings.json` to prevent incorrect re-runs after application restarts.
- **`AutoRunManager.cs` Compile Error (CS0117)**: Resolved by adding the missing `ReportHelper.GetPreviousDayOfWeek` method.
- **`AutoRunManager.cs` Compile Error (CS1739)**: Removed an incorrect `isAutoRun` parameter from a call to `FolderCreation.CreateReportSpecificFolder`.

---

## [1.8.8] - 2025-05-20

### Added
- **Configurable Email Greetings via UI**:
    - Introduced a new "Manage Email Greetings" option under the "Options" menu in `Form1.cs`.
    - This opens a new `ManageGreetingsForm.cs` which allows users to:
        - View and edit greetings for all email scenarios (Automated Standard Daily, Manual Standard Daily, Automated 5-Day Report, Manual Femi-Only, Manual Team, and Debug Default).
        - Save custom greetings. User-defined greetings are stored in `user_greeting_settings.json` in the user's `AppData\Roaming\HarlowSolutions\QuoteConversionReportAutomation` directory.
        - Restore all greetings to application defaults (from `appsettings.json`) by clearing user overrides.
    - Created `GreetingManager.cs` to handle the logic of loading default greetings from `appsettings.json`, loading user-defined overrides, saving overrides, and providing the effective greeting for any given context.
    - Added `UserGreetingSettings.cs` model to represent the structure of user-defined greeting overrides.

### Changed
- **Email Greeting Logic (`Form1.cs`, `AutoRunManager.cs`)**:
    - Both `Form1.cs` (for manual reports) and `AutoRunManager.cs` (for automated reports) now utilize the new `GreetingManager` to fetch email greetings. This ensures that greetings respect `appsettings.json` defaults and any user-configured overrides.
- **Configuration (`appsettings.json`)**:
    - Email greetings have been reorganized and grouped under `EmailGreetings` sub-objects within the `settings:ProductionEmails` and `settings:DebugEmails` sections for improved clarity and structure.
- **UI Conditional Visibility**:
    - In `ManageEmailRecipientsForm.cs`, the UI fields related to Debug email recipients are now hidden if the application is not running in a DEBUG build configuration.
    - Similarly, in the new `ManageGreetingsForm.cs`, the UI field for the "Debug Default Greeting" is hidden if not in a DEBUG build.
- **Application Version**: Incremented to `1.8.8` in `Form1.cs`.

### Fixed
- **Compile Error in `AutoRunManager.cs`**: Resolved a `CS0103` error where `ProdEmailGreetingsSectionKey` was referenced out of context after the introduction of `GreetingManager`. The `GreetingManager` now fully encapsulates the logic for retrieving greeting strings, including their paths in `appsettings.json`.
- **Ambiguity Error in `ManageEmailRecipientsForm.cs`**: Removed redundant private field declarations for UI controls that were already defined in the `ManageEmailRecipientsForm.Designer.cs` file, resolving compiler ambiguity errors.

---

## [1.8.7] - 2025-05-20 

### Added
- **Configurable Manual Standard Daily Email Recipients**:
    - Users can now configure specific 'To' and 'CC' recipients for manually run Standard Daily reports separately from automated daily reports.
    - Added new fields ("Manual Std. Daily TO:", "Manual Std. Daily CC:") to the `ManageEmailRecipientsForm.cs` UI.
    - Corresponding settings (`ManualRunDailyTo`, `ManualRunDailyCC`) added to `settings:ProductionEmails` in `appsettings.json` to store defaults.
    - `UserEmailSettings.cs` model updated with `ProdManualRunDailyTo` and `ProdManualRunDailyCC` properties.
- **Menu Item for Greeting Management**: Added "Manage Email Greetings" to the Options menu in `Form1.Designer.cs` (handler implemented in `Form1.cs`).

### Changed
- **Email Recipient Logic (`EmailRecipientManager.cs`)**:
    - `GetRecipients` method updated to strictly use debug recipients (`DebugEmails:To`, `CC1`, `CC2`) for *all* report types and contexts (manual or automated) when in `DEBUG` build mode.
    - In `RELEASE` mode, for manually run Standard Daily reports (`DailyReportIndex`), recipients are now fetched from the new `ProdManualRunDailyTo` and `ProdManualRunDailyCC` configurations.
- **Email Greeting Logic (`Form1.cs`)**:
    - The email greeting for manually run Standard Daily reports in `RELEASE` mode is now fetched from a configurable key (`settings:ProductionEmails:EmailGreetings:ManualStdDaily`) via `GreetingManager`.
- **UI Labels (`Form1.cs`)**: Updated `emailRecipientLabel` text for "Daily" report type to reflect configurable lists.
- **Application Version**: Incremented to `1.8.7`.

### Fixed
- **ComboBox Text Matching**: Corrected `GetSelectedReportTypeIndex` in `Form1.cs` to match exact ComboBox item text (e.g., "Daily" instead of "Daily Report").

---

## [1.8.5] - 2025-05-20 

### Changed
- **Data Processing (`ExcelCopyData.cs`)**:
    - Ensured intensive filtering operations in `FilterDataSheetAsync` and `FilterAnalysisSheetForZeroEstimatesAsync` (specifically for "Daily (5days >= £1000)" report) are explicitly run on background threads using `Task.Run` to prevent UI hanging.
    - Corrected formula propagation in `ExtractUniqueCustomersAsync` to ensure relative formulas in template columns (like B and C) are correctly copied and adjusted for new rows, rather than being overwritten or cleared prematurely.
- **Application Version**: Incremented to `1.8.5`.

### Fixed
- **UI Hanging**: Addressed UI hanging during "Daily (5days >= £1000)" report generation by ensuring filtering loops in `ExcelCopyData.cs` run on background threads.
- **Excel Formula Propagation**: Corrected logic in `ExcelCopyData.cs` to properly copy and adjust relative formulas from the template's "Analysis" sheet to new rows, particularly for columns B and C.
- **Stack Overflow**: Fixed a stack overflow error during form theming (especially `HelpForm`) by correcting recursive calls in `UIManager.cs`. The instance `ApplyTheme` method now correctly handles its own form's title bar theming without incorrectly calling the static `ApplyThemeToExternalForm` on itself.

---

## [1.8.4] - 2025-05-20

### Added
- **New Report Type**: "Daily (5days >= £1000)" report option added.
    - Generates a report covering the previous five working days, accounting for weekends and bank holidays.
    - After initial raw data copy to the "DATA" sheet, it filters this sheet in-place to retain only rows where 'Net Value' (Column H) is £1000 or greater.
    - The "Analysis" sheet is then populated with unique customers derived from this filtered data.
- **Configurable Auto-Run Reports**:
    - New "Options" sub-menu ("Configure Auto-Run Reports") added to `Form1.cs`.
    - Provides checkable sub-menu items to individually enable/disable:
        - "Enable Standard Daily Auto Report"
        - "Enable Daily (5days >= £1000) Auto Report"
    - These toggle settings are saved to and loaded from `appsettings.json` (`AutoReport:EnableStandardDailyAutoReport` and `AutoReport:EnableDaily5Day1kAutoReport`).
- **Email Configuration for New Report**:
    - Added specific, configurable email recipients (To/CC) for the automated "Daily (5days >= £1000)" report.
    - `ManageEmailRecipientsForm.cs` updated with new UI fields to allow user configuration of these recipient lists.
    - Initial default "To" for this automated report set to `chrisp@harlowsolutions.co.uk`.

### Changed
- **Auto-Run Logic (`AutoRunManager.cs`)**:
    - Modified to attempt running both the standard daily report and the new "Daily (5days >= £1000)" report during the auto-run cycle, provided each is enabled via its respective setting in `appsettings.json`.
    - Each automated report now uses its own specifically configured recipient list.
- **Data Processing (`ExcelCopyData.cs`)**:
    - Filtering logic for the "Daily (5days >= £1000)" report now occurs by:
        1. Performing a full copy of the 5-day raw data to the "DATA" sheet.
        2. Filtering the "DATA" sheet *in-place* by deleting rows where Net Value (Column H) is less than £1000.
        3. Proceeding with unique customer extraction for the "Analysis" sheet based on the filtered "DATA" sheet.
    - Ensured intensive filtering operations in `FilterDataSheetAsync` and `FilterAnalysisSheetForZeroEstimatesAsync` are explicitly run on background threads using `Task.Run` to prevent UI hanging.
    - Corrected formula propagation in `ExtractUniqueCustomersAsync` to ensure relative formulas in template columns (like B and C) are correctly copied and adjusted for new rows, rather than being overwritten or cleared prematurely.
- **Email Recipient Management (`EmailRecipientManager.cs`)**:
    - The `GetRecipients` method now includes an `isAutoRunContext` parameter to correctly select recipients for manual vs. automated report runs.
    - `Form1.cs` updated to call `GetRecipients` with `isAutoRunContext: false` for manually triggered reports.
- **Configuration (`appsettings.json`)**:
    - Added `EnableStandardDailyAutoReport: true` and `EnableDaily5Day1kAutoReport: true` under the `AutoReport` section.
    - Added `AutoRunDaily5Day1kTo` and `AutoRunDaily5Day1kCC` lists under `settings.ProductionEmails`.
- **Help Text (`Form1.cs`)**: Updated to describe the new "Configure Auto-Run Reports" menu and the behavior of the "Daily (5days >= £1000)" report.
- **Application Version**: Incremented to `1.8.4`.

### Fixed
- **UI Hanging**: Addressed UI hanging during "Daily (5days >= £1000)" report generation by ensuring filtering loops in `ExcelCopyData.cs` run on background threads.
- **Excel Formula Propagation**: Corrected logic in `ExcelCopyData.cs` to properly copy and adjust relative formulas from the template's "Analysis" sheet to new rows, particularly for columns B and C.
- **`ExcelCopyData.cs`**:
    - Corrected the arguments for the `DeleteRow` method in the EPPlus library to prevent errors.
    - Resolved a scope issue related to `ExcelTemplateBaseDir` when checking for monthly templates during pivot table refresh logic for custom reports; now uses `templateFilePathUsed` passed down to `ProcessPostCopyOperationsAsync`.
- **UI**: Ensured `GetSelectedReportTypeIndex` in `Form1.cs` uses case-insensitive matching for robustness and handles various ComboBox states correctly.
- **Stack Overflow**: Fixed a stack overflow error during form theming (especially `HelpForm`) by correcting recursive calls in `UIManager.cs`. The instance `ApplyTheme` method now correctly handles its own form's title bar theming without incorrectly calling the static `ApplyThemeToExternalForm` on itself.

---

## [1.8.1] - 2025-05-14

### Changed
- **Theming**: Modified so Title bar is now in the correct theme mode, also made menu bar and status strip different colours to help them stand out.
- **HelpForm**: RTF container now follows theme.

### Fixed
- Ensured UI Controls are set to the correct theme colours.

---

## [1.8.0] - 2025-05-12

### Changed
- **Annual Report Dates**: Modified the "Annual" report type to use a financial year running from May 1st to April 30th, instead of a calendar year. This affects date calculations in `Form1.cs` and `ReportHelper.cs`, and the corresponding descriptions in email subjects/bodies and help text.
- **Help Text**: Updated the help text for the "Annual" report type to reflect the May-April financial year.
- **Email Content**: Adjusted the email subject and body for "Annual" reports to correctly state the financial year range (e.g., "Financial Year 2023-2024").
- **Filename Logic**: Ensured that filename generation and expected path checks for "Annual" reports use a consistent date (the start of the financial year, e.g., May 1st) for clarity.

### Fixed
- Ensured UI controls (especially the Auto-Run button and main action buttons) are consistently re-enabled and their text/status updated correctly after an automated run cycle completes or is bypassed by the timer.
- Removed a redundant UI update call when toggling the 1-Click processing mode to potentially improve responsiveness.

---

## [1.7.9] - 2025-05-09

### Added
- **1-Click Processing Mode**: Introduced a new "Enable 1-Click Processing" option in the "Options" menu. When enabled, the "Create Report" and "Process and Email" buttons are replaced by a single "Generate, Process & Email Report" button to perform all actions sequentially.
- **Skip Sending Email Option**: Added a "Skip Sending Email" checkbox within the "Report Settings" group box. If checked, the email sending step is bypassed during manual or 1-Click processing.
- **Configurable Auto-Run Hour**: Added an option under "Options" menu ("Set Auto-Run Hour...") to allow users to change the hour (0-23) at which the daily automated report task executes. This setting is saved in `appsettings.json`.
- **Auto-Run Time Display on Button**: The "Enable/Disable Daily Auto Run" button now displays the configured auto-run hour (e.g., "@ 8:00") as part of its text on application load and after changes.

### Changed
- **Help Text Enhancements**:
    - Significantly updated and expanded the RTF help text to be more comprehensive, explaining all new features, automated processes, and detailed troubleshooting steps.
    - Corrected RTF formatting for better readability, including ensuring spaces appear correctly after bolded text followed by colons and fixing bullet point alignment.
    - Revised Excel refresh instructions in the help text to be more specific about right-clicking PivotTables and Slicers in the "OrderPivot" and "Estimate Success PivotTable" sheets.
- **UI Manager**: Updated to correctly manage new UI elements related to 1-Click processing and skip email functionality. Also updated to correctly format the auto-run button text with the configured hour.
- **AutoRunManager**: Modified to use and persist the configurable auto-run hour.
- **Form1 Logic**:
    - Implemented event handlers and UI logic for the new 1-Click processing mode, skip email checkbox, and setting the auto-run hour.
    - Ensured the `toggleAutoRunButton` text is updated on application load and when the hour is changed to reflect the currently configured auto-run hour.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where the auto-run button text might not update correctly to "Disable..." when toggled.
- Corrected RTF formatting for help text to ensure proper spacing and bullet point rendering.

---

## [1.7.4] - 2025-05-09

### Added
- **Email Recipient Management Feature**:
    - Added a new "Manage Email Recipients" option under the "Options" menu in `Form1.cs`.
    - This opens a new `ManageEmailRecipientsForm` which allows users to:
        - View current email recipients for different report types and scenarios (Production: AutoRun Daily, Femi Only, Team; Debug: To, CC1, CC2).
        - Edit these recipient lists (multiple emails can be entered, separated by commas or semicolons).
        - Save their custom recipient settings. These overrides are stored in a `user_email_settings.json` file in the user's `AppData\Roaming\HarlowSolutions\QuoteConversionReportAutomation` directory.
        - Restore all recipients to the application defaults defined in `appsettings.json` (this deletes the user override file).
    - Introduced `UserEmailSettings.cs` as the data model for storing user-defined recipient lists.
    - Created `EmailRecipientManager.cs` to:
        - Load default recipients from `appsettings.json`.
        - Load user-defined overrides from `user_email_settings.json`.
        - Provide the effective email recipients by merging defaults with overrides (overrides take precedence).
        - Save user overrides to `user_email_settings.json`.
        - Clear user overrides to restore defaults.
        - Validate email address formats.
    - The `ManageEmailRecipientsForm` includes theming support (Dark/Light mode) consistent with the main application.

### Changed
- **Form1.cs**:
    - Updated `GetEmailRecipients()` to use `EmailRecipientManager` to determine To/CC lists, thus incorporating user overrides.
    - Corrected calls for `GetPreviousWorkday` to use `ReportHelper.GetPreviousWorkday` instead of `BankHolidayHelper.GetPreviousWorkday`.
    - Refactored `createReportButton_Click` and `processEmailButton_Click` event handlers from `async Task` back to `async void`. Core async logic moved to new `PerformCreateReportAsync()` and `PerformProcessAndEmailAsync()` methods.
    - Corrected references to `autoRunStatusLabel.Text`.
    - Corrected configuration key for `ExcelTemplateBaseDir` to `settings:ExcelTemplateFolder`.
    - Updated help text to include the new "Manage Email Recipients" feature.
- **AutoRunManager.cs**:
    - Updated constructor to accept `EmailRecipientManager`.
    - Modified `RunAutomatedDailyReportAsync` to use injected `EmailRecipientManager` for email recipients.
- **Application Version**: Updated to `1.7.4`.

---

## [1.7.2] - 2025-05-09
